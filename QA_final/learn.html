          <h2>Espresso</h2>
          <img class="modal-img" src="img/learn/espresso.jpg">
          <p>Choose High-Quality Coffee Beans:
            Start with fresh, high-quality coffee beans. Consider a blend of Arabica and Robusta beans for a well-rounded flavor.
            <br><br>
            Use the Right Grind Size:
            Grind the coffee beans to a fine consistency, ensuring a uniform texture for even extraction.
            <br><br>
            Measure the Coffee Dose:
            Accurately measure the coffee dose for your espresso. A standard single shot typically requires 7-9 grams of coffee.
            <br><br>
            Tamp the Coffee Grounds:
            Tamp the coffee grounds evenly and firmly in the portafilter. Apply approximately 30 pounds of pressure to create a smooth and level coffee puck.
            <br><br>
            Maintain the Correct Water Temperature:
            Ensure that the water temperature falls between 195°F to 205°F (90°C to 96°C). Consistent water temperature is essential for optimal extraction.
            <br><br>
            Control Brew Time:
            Aim for an extraction time of around 25-30 seconds for a single shot of espresso. Adjust the grind size if the extraction time is too fast or too slow.
            <br><br>
            Monitor Pressure:
            Espresso machines typically operate at 9 bars of pressure. Ensure consistent pressure throughout the extraction process.
            <br><br>
            Consider Pre-infusion:
            If your espresso machine offers pre-infusion, use this feature to wet the coffee grounds before full extraction. It helps release gases and promotes even extraction.
            <br><br>
            Serve Immediately:
            Espresso is best enjoyed immediately after extraction. Its flavor degrades quickly, so serve promptly to savor the full taste.
            <br><br>
            Regularly Clean Your Equipment:
            Keep your espresso machine clean by regularly cleaning the portafilter, group head, and other components to prevent the buildup of coffee oils and residues.
            <br><br>
            Use Filtered Water:
            Ensure the water you use is filtered to avoid impurities that might affect the taste of your espresso.
            <br><br>
            Experiment and Enjoy:
            Feel free to experiment with different coffee beans, grind sizes, and extraction times to find the perfect flavor profile that suits your taste preferences.

          <h2>Moka Pot Brewing</h2>
          <img class="modal-img" src="img/learn/moka.jpg">
          <p>The Moka pot, also known as a stovetop espresso maker, is a classic and iconic way to make strong and flavorful coffee. Here's a step-by-step guide:
            <br><br>
            Prepare Your Coffee:
            <br>
            Start by selecting high-quality coffee beans. A medium to dark roast works well with the Moka pot, providing a rich and robust flavor.
            <br><br>
            Measure Your Coffee:
            <br>
            Measure your coffee grounds, aiming for a coffee-to-water ratio of about 1:7. Adjust the amount based on your preference for a stronger or milder brew.
            <br><br>
            Grind Your Coffee:
            <br>
            Grind your coffee beans to a medium-fine consistency, similar to table salt. The grind should not be too coarse or too fine to ensure proper extraction.
            <br><br>
            Fill the Moka Pot:
            <br>
            Disassemble the Moka pot and fill the bottom chamber with cold water up to the safety valve. Place finely ground coffee into the filter basket, leveling it off without packing it down.
            <br><br>
            Assemble the Moka Pot:
            <br>
            Reassemble the Moka pot, ensuring a tight seal. Place it on the stovetop over medium heat. Keep the lid open during brewing.
            <br><br>
            Watch and Listen:
            <br>
            As the water in the bottom chamber heats up, it will create pressure, forcing the hot water through the coffee grounds. Listen for a hissing sound, indicating that the brewing process is complete.
            <br><br>
            Monitor the Brew:
            <br>
            Keep an eye on the top chamber. Once it's full of brewed coffee, remove the Moka pot from the heat to prevent over-extraction and burnt flavors.
            <br><br>
            Serve and Enjoy:
            <br>
            Pour the brewed coffee into your cup or mug. The result is a strong and concentrated coffee with a layer of crema on top, resembling espresso. Add hot water or milk to customize your drink.
            <br><br>
            Clean the Moka Pot:
            <br>
            After use, disassemble the Moka pot and rinse all components with warm water. Avoid using soap, as it can affect the flavor of future brews.
            <br><br>
            Experiment and Adjust:
            <br>
            Experiment with different coffee beans, grind sizes, and ratios to find the perfect combination for your taste preferences.</p>
